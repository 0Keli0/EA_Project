chaining --> split of an image in 9 and the merge solution
experiments --> images about initial_population and types of reproduction created by the module experiments.py
images of the results --> images used at the results in the pdf
pictures --> folder to save the images of the search
solutions --> some solutions saved 
    pictures1 --> GA 
    pictures2 --> Best GA
    multi-used --> best GA_Multi
        Not the best --> GA_Multi

Be careful with the module Colour --> there are some problems with dependences with the colour-science library.
